# DataStructuresImplementation

**About repository:**

This repository consists of five parts as you can see above.From all of them:
__datastructure-0.1__ is  the main project part. __C files__ folder contain
all C files capable of working as an independent module explaining the implementations
 of Data Structures in the project. __Code Blocks__ is the part when i initially
 created project on code blocks. __Header files__ folder contain all header
files that are created while working on this project.
__Project zipped(datastructure-0.1).zip__ file is a commpressed version of the project.

**Building and Installing the Aeolus Recipe**

The main project directory is __datastructure-0.1__. To Build and Install the Project clone
the repository, move into the __datastructure-0.1__ directory and in terminal type following commands:

**1. ./config**

**2. make**

**3. sudo make install**

After doing this, run program by typing on terminal DataStructure.
